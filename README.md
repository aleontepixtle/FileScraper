# FileScraper
 Receives a file and scrapes the content for text and stores in a list/dictionary/set.

Functions have been added on pdfscraper_functions.py to simplify and
modularize the code. Loops iterate through each line and search for
key words to add to a list, then a method will recall those lists in
the order of their occurrence.
